      <description>Willliam Legue, Cybersecurity professional, Home brewer and craft beer enthusiast, Musician, Gamer, and father. I have been an IT hobbyist for most of my life, but really Iâ€™m just a hobbyist for just about anything that peaks my interest. I have the tendency to dive into interests head first and try to learn everything about it. It started with music, I was a professional musician for the better part of a decade before shifting focus and breaking into cybersecurity.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been an IT enthusiast for most of my life. Really ever since my Dad started showing me how to upgrade our family computer so I could play Lego Island in the late 90s. I got the game as a present, but after installing it the game was completely unplayable. We needed a graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
