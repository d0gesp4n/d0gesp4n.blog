      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using security onion for a long time now. I started dabbling with it while I was studying for my B.S. and have continued to use it throughout my career. It has been my go to platform for anything NSM related or a platform for learning SIEM administration. Security onion is a great platform, out of the box youâ€™re pretty much setup to start monitoring your network as it comes with great tools that require little configuration to get started. Suricata or Snort for IDS and ZEEK or Suricata for network metadata. It even offers PCAPs along with Syslog ingestion and endpoint monitoring options. The list could really continue on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been an IT enthusiast for most of my life. Really ever since my Dad started showing me how to upgrade our family computer so I could play Lego Island in the late 90s. I got the game as a present, but after installing it the game was completely unplayable. We needed a graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
